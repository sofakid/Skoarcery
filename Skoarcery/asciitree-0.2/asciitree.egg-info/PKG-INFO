Description: ASCII Trees
        ===========
        
        Occasionally, you want things to look slightly pretty in the terminal. If trees are involved, give asciitree a shot!
        
        Sample output
        -------------
        
        Here's a code sample::
        
            class Node(object):
                def __init__(self, name, children):
                    self.name = name
                    self.children = children
        
                def __str__(self):
                    return self.name
        
            root = Node('root', [
                Node('sub1', []),
                Node('sub2', [
                    Node('sub2sub1', [])
                ]),
                Node('sub3', [
                    Node('sub3sub1', [
                        Node('sub3sub1sub1', [])
                    ]),
                    Node('sub3sub2', [])
                ])
            ])
        
            print draw_tree(root)
        
        
        and its output::
        
             root
               +--sub1
               +--sub2
               |  +--sub2sub1
               +--sub3
                  +--sub3sub1
                  |  +--sub3sub1sub1
                  +--sub3sub2
        
        
        API
        ---
        
        The module consists of a single public function, with the following signature:
        
        ``draw_tree(node, child_iter, text_str)``
        
        where ``node`` is the root of the tree to be drawn, ``child_iter`` is a
        function that when called with a node, returns an iterable over all its
        children and ``text_str`` turns a node into the text to be displayed in the
        tree.
        
        The default implementations of these two arguments retrieve the children by
        accessing ``node.children`` and simply use ``str(node)`` to convert a node to a
        string.
        
        The resulting tree is drawn into a buffer and returned as a string.
